# Food Delivery App

A full-stack food delivery website built with React (frontend) and Express (backend).

## Project Structure

```
client/   # React frontend
server/   # Express backend
```

## Tech Stack
- React (frontend)
- Express (backend)
- Node.js

## Features Completed So Far
- Basic React app setup (Create React App)
- Basic Express server setup
- Initial folder structure for components, context, and screens

## How to Run

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `client` folder:
   ```sh
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React app:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The app will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `server` folder:
   ```sh
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Express server:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
   The server will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or your configured port)

## Next Steps / TODO
- Implement user authentication (login/register)
- Add restaurant and menu browsing
- Implement cart and order management
- Connect frontend to backend APIs
- Add admin panel for managing food items and orders
- Improve UI/UX and responsiveness

## Original Create React App Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
